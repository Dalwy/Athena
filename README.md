An app designed around Housing and Apartments. 

The app was designed around creating an AR iOS Application that implemented Zillow API, Google Cloud Platform,
and also using Mongo DB for our database. This app allows users to receive basic
housing information right at your fingertips.


## The Goal.
 * The overall goal with the app was to help entice people to learn more about the home buying practices. Also to create freindly habbits for later on in life.
